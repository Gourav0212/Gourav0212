# Gourav Dutt Shrimali

**Software Developer | Competitive Programming Enthusiast | Problem Solver**

I am a Software Developer with a strong focus on writing efficient, maintainable code. My technical foundation is built on a deep understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming. I enjoy deconstructing complex logic into optimized solutions and am constantly looking for ways to improve system performance.

I spend a significant amount of my time on platforms like GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode, not just to solve problems, but to understand the most efficient ways to handle data and logic at scale.
